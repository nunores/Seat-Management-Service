## openCX - Seat Management Service (SMS)

In this project we developed a mobile application with Flutter, using the SCRUM project management methodology. The purpose of project was to contribute to the openCX conference solutions in a Covid-19-like environment where social distancing is highly valued and to learn more insight about agile development.

## Product Vision

**A safe, self distanced, conference seat for everyone.**

## Elevator Pitch

Nowadays, due to COVID-19, everyone is afraid of attending conferences because we don't know who is sitting beside us. SMS has the solution for you. Our app can reserve your seat and immediately make it unavailable, alongside the seats immediatly next to yours. This way it's possible to keep a secure distance between all participants and confortably watch the session.

### Domain model

![Domain Model](https://github.com/FEUP-ESOF-2020-21/open-cx-t6g2-sms/blob/master/docs/problem_domain.png)

## Architecture and Design

### Logical architecture

![Logical Architecture](https://github.com/FEUP-ESOF-2020-21/open-cx-t6g2-sms/blob/master/docs/Logic.png)

Our project is organized in an MVC-like structure. The Model package contains components for the objects present: conference, user and date. All of these are informations that need to be stored and manipulated throught the product's usage. In the View package, the conference_view component describes how a conference is presented to the screen and handles the user interactability. The Controller package contains information on the various pages of our project, pages to handle the registry and sign in processes, the main page, the page for the administration, pages for seat reservation. etc. These are the components that tie together all of the program's pieces.

### Physical architecture

![Physical Architecture](https://github.com/FEUP-ESOF-2020-21/open-cx-t6g2-sms/blob/master/docs/Physical.png)

The only thing needed to run the project is a smartphone. The user interacts with the application directly by touching specific buttons whenever they are prompted. Since we have some handling of the user's inputs, we called it "hidden processing", as these are changes in the database, prompts for the user at an adequate time, alert dialogs on invalid inputs, and all other unpredictable actions that need to be taken in consideration.

The technology used is Flutter, a Dart framework that allows the app to run both on Android and iOS operating systems.
